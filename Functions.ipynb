        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "-> A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is a standalone entity and is not associated with any particular object or class.Example of fucntion:\n",
        "\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(5, 3)  ----- Calling the function\n",
        "print(result)  ----- Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A method is also a block of reusable code that performs a specific task, but it is associated with an object or a class. Methods are functions that belong to a class and are designed to operate on the data (attributes) of an object created from that class.\n",
        "Example of method:\n",
        "\n",
        "class ToyCar:\n",
        "    def honk(self):  ----- 'self' means it works on THIS specific car\n",
        "        print(\"Beep beep!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "my_car = ToyCar()\n",
        "\n",
        "my_car.honk()    ----- We tell MY_CAR to honk  Output: Beep beep!\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "-> Parameters are the placeholders for data when you define a function. They're what the function expects to receive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def greet(name):  ----- 'name' is the parameter\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Arguments are the actual data you send when you call a function. They fill the parameter's spot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  ----- \"Alice\" is the argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "-> To define a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Basic definiton:\n",
        "eg. def my_function():\n",
        "    print(\"This is a simple function.\")\n",
        "\n",
        "- With parameters:\n",
        "  You can define a function to accept inputs (parameters) inside the parentheses.\n",
        "eg. def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "- With Default Parameters:\n",
        "  You can give parameters default values. If you don't provide an argument for that parameter when calling, the default value is used.\n",
        "eg. def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
        "    print(f\"{message}, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lambda Functions:\n",
        "  These are small, single-expression functions that you don't necessarily name. They are defined using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "eg. multiply = lambda x, y: x * y\n",
        "\n",
        "-> To call a function:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calling a Function with No Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "eg. my_function()  Calls the function defined above\n",
        " ----- Output: This is a simple function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calling a Function with Positional Arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "eg. result = add_numbers(5, 3)  ----- 5 goes to 'a', 3 goes to 'b'\n",
        "print(result)  ----- Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calling a Function with Default Arguments (and overriding them):\n",
        "\n",
        "eg. greet(\"Alice\") ----- Uses the default message \"Hello\"\n",
        " Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"John\", \"Good morning\")  ----- Overrides the default message\n",
        " Output: Good morning, John!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calling a Lambda Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "eg. prod = multiply(4, 5)\n",
        "print(prod) ----- Output: 20\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
        "-> The return statement in a Python function does two things:\n",
        "- It sends a result from the function to wherever the function was called.\n",
        "- It immediately stops the function's execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "def multiply(x, y):\n",
        "    return x * y ----- Returns the product to the caller\n",
        "\n",
        "product = multiply(4, 5)\n",
        "print(product) ----- Output: 20\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "-> Iterators:\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It provides a way to access elements one at a time and remembers its current position during iteration.\n",
        "To be an iterator, an object must implement two methods (this is known as the \"iterator protocol\"):\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__(): This method must return the iterator object itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "__next__(): This method must return the next item from the iteration. If there are no more items, it must raise a StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_iterator = iter(my_list) ----- my_iterator is now an iterator object\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) ----- Calls __next__()\n",
        "----- Output: 1\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) ----- Calls __next__() again\n",
        "----- Output: 2\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) ----- Calls __next__() one more time\n",
        "----- Output: 3\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) ----- it will raise a StopIteration error\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Iterables:\n",
        "An iterable is any object that you can \"iterate over,\" meaning you can go through its elements one by one. This is what you typically use in a for loop.\n",
        "To be an iterable, an object must define either:\n",
        "\n",
        "An __iter__() method that returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "A __getitem__() method that can take sequential integer indices (starting from 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "Lists ([])\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples (())\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings (\"\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries ({})\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets ({})\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "-> Generators in Python are a special kind of iterator that you can define. Their main purpose is to create iterators in a very simple and memory-efficient way.\n",
        "Example: def count_up_to(max_num):\n",
        "    n = 0\n",
        "    while n <= max_num:\n",
        "        yield n\n",
        "        n += 1\n",
        "----- Using the generator in a for loop (which implicitly calls next())\n",
        "print(\"Counting from generator:\")\n",
        "for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
        "    print(number)\n",
        "----- Output:\n",
        "-- Counting from generator:\n",
        "-- 0\n",
        "-- 1\n",
        "-- 2\n",
        "-- 3\n",
        "-- 4\n",
        "-- 5\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "-> The advantages of using generators over regular functions are:\n",
        "- Memory Efficiency: Generators produce values one at a time, on demand. They don't store the entire sequence in memory. This is crucial for very large datasets or infinite sequences, preventing memory exhaustion.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Performance (Lazy Evaluation): Values are computed only when they are needed. This can save significant computation time if you don't end up using all items in a sequence.\n",
        "Simplicity and Readability: Writing a generator (using yield) is often much simpler and more readable than writing a custom iterator class with __iter__ and __next__ methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Infinite Sequences: Since generators don't need to store the entire sequence, they can effectively represent infinite sequences, generating values as long as they are requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pipelining/Streaming: Generators are excellent for building data processing pipelines. One generator can feed data to another without needing to store intermediate results in large lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a generator:\n",
        "\n",
        "def simple_generator():\n",
        "    yield \"Hello\"\n",
        "    yield \"World\"\n",
        "\n",
        "----- Create the generator object\n",
        "gen = simple_generator()\n",
        "\n",
        "-----  Get values one by one\n",
        "print(next(gen)) ----- Output: Hello\n",
        "print(next(gen)) ----- Output: World\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "-> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous (meaning it doesn't have a name) function defined with a single expression. It can only contain one expression, which is implicitly returned. You cannot have multiple statements, loops, or complex logic within a lambda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need a quick, one-off function for a trivial task.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Lambda functions are used as arguments to Higher-Order Functions. This is their most common use-case. Many built-in functions (like map(), filter(), sorted()) and methods (like list.sort() with a key argument) accept a function as an argument. Lambdas are perfect for providing these small, custom functions directly without formally defining them elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "----- A list of (name, age) tuples\n",
        "people = [(\"Alice\", 30), (\"Bob\", 25), (\"Charlie\", 35)]\n",
        "\n",
        "----- Using a lambda function as the 'key' for sorting\n",
        "----- It tells sorted() to use the second element (index 1) of each tuple for comparison\n",
        "sorted_people = sorted(people, key=lambda person: person[1])\n",
        "\n",
        "print(sorted_people)\n",
        "----- Output: [('Bob', 25), ('Alice', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "-> The map() function in Python is a built-in higher-order function that applies a given function to all items in an input iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n",
        "The main purpose of map() is to transform or modify each item in an iterable without explicitly writing a for loop. It's a concise and often more efficient way to apply an operation across an entire collection of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "----- Define a function to square a number\n",
        "def square(x):\n",
        "    return x * x\n",
        "\n",
        "----- Use map() to apply the 'square' function to each number\n",
        "squared_numbers_map_object = map(square, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "----- Convert the map object to a list to see the results\n",
        "squared_numbers_list = list(squared_numbers_map_object)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(squared_numbers_list)\n",
        "----- Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
        "-> map():\n",
        "- Purpose: To transform each item in an iterable. It applies a given function to every item and creates a new iterable (or rather, an iterator) with the transformed results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How it works: It takes each individual item, applies the function, and yields a new item. The length of the output is typically the same as the input (unless multiple iterables are involved).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Returns: A map object (an iterator).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "squared = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))\n",
        "print(squared) ----- Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "\n",
        "reduce():\n",
        "- Purpose: To aggregate or combine all items in an iterable into a single cumulative result. It applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How it works: It takes the first two items, applies the function, then takes that result and the next item, applies the function again, and so on, until all items are processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Returns: A single, accumulated value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "from functools import reduce\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\n",
        "print(sum_of_numbers) ----- Output: 10 ((((1+2)+3)+4) = 10)\n",
        "\n",
        "filter():\n",
        "- Purpose: To select (filter out) items from an iterable based on a condition. It constructs a new iterable (or an iterator) with only the items for which the given function returns True.\n",
        "\n",
        "- How it works: It takes each individual item, applies a function that returns True or False. If True, the item is included; if False, it's discarded. The length of the output is usually less than or equal to the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Returns: A filter object (an iterator).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
